airbnb 2015 challenge

What can we learn about user behavior from the airbnb challenge? 
[http://databits.io/challenges/airbnb-user-pathways-challenge]

The one-line version:
"The ultimate goal is to build an interactive visualization that helps tell a compelling and crisp story of user behavior on Airbnb."

Well, I'll see what compelling information can be gleaned but my impression, as-is, is that it defies crispiness unless the story is distilled down so far as to not need visualizing.
